# Implement Epic

Automatically implement all sub-issues of a parent epic in dependency order. Each sub-issue is implemented by a **sub-agent with its own context window**, keeping the main session lightweight for orchestration.

## Input

The user provides a parent issue number: `$ARGUMENTS`

FOLLOW ALL STEPS STRICTLY. NO SHORTCUTS. This skill runs autonomously — no confirmation stops between sub-issues.

## Tool Rules

- Use Glob to find files — NEVER use `find` or `ls` via Bash
- Use Grep to search file contents — NEVER use `grep` or `rg` via Bash
- Use Read to read files — NEVER use `cat`, `head`, or `tail` via Bash
- Bash is for `gh` commands, `git` commands, running tests, and `~/.claude/bin/` scripts only
- NEVER write files via Bash (no `echo >`, `cat <<`, `tee`, heredoc) — use the Write tool to write to `/tmp/`, then reference the file
- NEVER use `python3 -c`, `sed`, or `awk` for file modifications — use Grep to find occurrences, then Edit to replace them
- Use Write to create new files — NEVER use `mkdir` via Bash (Write auto-creates parent directories)
- Use `git rm` to delete files — NEVER use `rm` via Bash
- For batch operations on multiple issues, use `~/.claude/bin/` scripts (e.g., `batch-issue-status.sh`, `batch-issue-view.sh`) — NEVER use `for` loops in Bash

Follow the Test Quality Policy and Anti-Patterns from CLAUDE.md throughout all phases.

## Architecture

```
Main session (orchestrator):
├── Phase 0: Setup — parse epic, determine waves, create feature branch + tracking PR
├── Wave 1:
│   ├── Task agent → implement issue #A (own context window)
│   │   └── returns: { status: "success", pr: 42 } or { status: "failed", error: "..." }
│   ├── Task agent → implement issue #B (own context window)
│   ├── Handle results: update tracking PR
│   └── (repeat for all issues in wave)
├── Wave 2-N: same pattern
└── Phase Final: summary
```

The main session NEVER implements code itself. It only:
- Parses the epic and determines execution order
- Spawns Task agents for each sub-issue
- Handles results (success/failure/skip)
- Updates the tracking PR
- Creates bug issues on failure

## Phase 0: Setup

### Step 1: Read parent issue

```bash
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --json title,body,labels
```

### Step 2: Parse sub-issues and implementation order

Parse the issue body for:
- **Sub-issues:** Extract issue numbers from the tracking table or checklist
- **Implementation order:** Look for explicit ordering, dependency info, or phase numbers
- **Dependencies:** Which sub-issues depend on others (from "Depends On", "Blocked by" fields)

### Step 3: Determine waves

Group sub-issues into waves based on dependencies:
- **Wave 1:** Issues with no dependencies (can be implemented first)
- **Wave 2:** Issues that only depend on wave 1 issues
- **Wave N:** Issues that only depend on issues in earlier waves

Issues within the same wave are implemented sequentially (each needs the branch state from the previous).

### Step 4: Read project context

Read all CLAUDE.md files in the project (root, frontend, backend — whatever exists) and collect:
- Tech stack and project structure
- Test commands and validation commands
- Code quality policies

Store this as `project_context` — you will pass it to each sub-agent.

### Step 5: Check/create feature branch

```bash
git fetch origin
git branch -a --list "*issue-$ARGUMENTS*"
```

If the feature branch exists, check it out. Otherwise create it:
```bash
git checkout -b issue-$ARGUMENTS-<description>
```

Store the feature branch name as `feature_branch`.

### Step 6: Check/create tracking PR

Find existing tracking PR:
```bash
~/.claude/bin/find-tracking-pr.sh <repo> $ARGUMENTS
```

If no tracking PR exists, create a draft PR against `develop` using the Write tool to write the body to `/tmp/tracking-pr-body.md`, then:
```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "<Epic title>" --base develop --body-file /tmp/tracking-pr-body.md
```

Store the tracking PR number as `tracking_pr`.

### Step 7: Show overview and start

Display a summary of:
- Total sub-issues and wave structure
- Dependency graph
- Feature branch and tracking PR

Then proceed immediately — no confirmation stop.

## Phase 1-N: Per Wave

Process each wave sequentially. Within each wave, process sub-issues sequentially.

### Per sub-issue:

#### Step 1: Prepare the feature branch

Before spawning the sub-agent, ensure the feature branch is up to date:

```bash
git checkout <feature_branch>
git pull origin <feature_branch>
```

#### Step 2: Fetch issue details

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json title,body,labels
```

Store the issue title and body — you need this for the sub-agent prompt.

#### Step 3: Spawn sub-agent via Task tool

Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` to implement the sub-issue. The sub-agent gets its own context window and full tool access.

**The prompt must include everything the sub-agent needs** (it has no access to the main session's context):

```
Implement GitHub issue #<N> for epic #$ARGUMENTS.

## Issue
Title: <title>
Body: <full issue body>

## Project Context
<project_context from Phase 0 Step 4 — CLAUDE.md contents, tech stack, test commands>

## Branch Setup
- Feature branch: <feature_branch>
- Create sub-branch: issue-<N>-<description>
- Base your work on the feature branch (already checked out)

## Instructions

1. Create and checkout branch: `git checkout -b issue-<N>-<description>`
2. Read the codebase: use Glob, Grep, Read to understand relevant files
3. Implement the changes following the project policies above
4. Write tests following the Test Quality Policy
5. Run tests: <specific test command from CLAUDE.md>
6. If tests fail: fix and retry (up to 3 attempts total)
7. If tests pass:
   - Commit with a descriptive message (use Write to /tmp/commit-msg.txt, then `git commit -F /tmp/commit-msg.txt`)
   - Push: `git push -u origin issue-<N>-<description>`
   - Write PR body to /tmp/pr-body.md, then create PR:
     `gh pr create --title "<title>" --base <feature_branch> --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md`
   - Auto-merge: `gh pr merge <pr-number> --merge --delete-branch`
   - Return to feature branch: `git checkout <feature_branch> && git pull origin <feature_branch>`

## Tool Rules
- Use Glob to find files — NEVER use `find` or `ls` via Bash
- Use Grep to search file contents — NEVER use `grep` or `rg` via Bash
- Use Read to read files — NEVER use `cat`, `head`, or `tail` via Bash
- Bash is for `gh` commands, `git` commands, running tests, and `~/.claude/bin/` scripts only
- NEVER write files via Bash (no `echo >`, `cat <<`, `tee`, heredoc) — use the Write tool to write to `/tmp/`, then reference the file
- NEVER use `python3 -c`, `sed`, or `awk` for file modifications — use Grep to find occurrences, then Edit to replace them
- Use Write to create new files — NEVER use `mkdir` via Bash
- Use `git rm` to delete files — NEVER use `rm` via Bash

## Response Format

When done, respond with EXACTLY one of these formats:

SUCCESS:
PR_NUMBER: <number>
SUMMARY: <one-line description of what was implemented>

FAILED:
ERROR: <description of what went wrong>
ATTEMPTS: <what was tried>
LAST_ERROR_OUTPUT: <relevant error output>
```

#### Step 4: Handle sub-agent result

Parse the sub-agent's response:

**On success** (response contains `SUCCESS`):
- Extract PR number and summary
- Record: issue #N → ✅ Complete, PR #X

**On failure** (response contains `FAILED`):
1. **Create bug issue** — write body to `/tmp/bug-epic-<N>.md`:

```markdown
## Context
- Epic: #$ARGUMENTS
- Sub-issue: #<N> — <title>
- Feature branch: <feature_branch>

## Error
<error from sub-agent response>

## What Was Attempted
<attempts from sub-agent response>

## Last Error Output
<last_error_output from sub-agent response>

## Suggested Next Steps
- Investigate the error manually
- Check if dependencies are correctly set up
```

```bash
gh issue create --title "🐛 [Epic #$ARGUMENTS] Bug: <description>" --label bug --body-file /tmp/bug-epic-<N>.md
```

2. **Clean up failed branch** (if it was pushed):

```bash
git checkout <feature_branch>
git branch -D issue-<N>-<description>
```

3. **Mark dependent issues as skipped** — any issue in later waves that depends on this failed issue cannot proceed. Track which issues are skipped and why.

#### Step 5: Update tracking PR

After each sub-issue (success or failure), update the tracking PR:
- Update status in the tracking table (✅ Complete, ❌ Failed, ⏭️ Skipped)
- Update progress percentage
- Add PR link for successful issues
- Add bug issue link for failures

Write updated body to `/tmp/tracking-pr-update.md`, then:
```bash
gh pr edit <tracking_pr> --body-file /tmp/tracking-pr-update.md
```

## Phase Final: Wrap-up

### Step 1: Sync Closes statements

Ensure all completed sub-issue numbers are in the tracking PR body as `Closes #<N>` statements. Failed and skipped issues should NOT have Closes statements.

### Step 2: Show summary

Display a final report:

```markdown
## Epic #$ARGUMENTS — Implementation Complete

### Results
| # | Issue | Status | PR |
|---|-------|--------|-----|
| 1 | #XX — Title | ✅ Merged | #YY |
| 2 | #XX — Title | ❌ Failed → Bug #ZZ | - |
| 3 | #XX — Title | ⏭️ Skipped (depends on #XX) | - |

### Statistics
- ✅ Completed: X of Y
- ❌ Failed: X (bug issues created: #AA, #BB)
- ⏭️ Skipped: X

### Tracking PR
<tracking-pr-url>

The tracking PR is ready for manual review and merge to develop.
```

## Error Handling Summary

When a sub-agent reports failure:
1. Create a bug issue with full context (error, attempts, suggestions)
2. Add the bug issue to the tracking PR table
3. Delete the failed sub-branch (local + remote if pushed)
4. Check dependency graph: if issue X fails and issue Y depends on X → skip Y with a note
5. Continue with the next non-blocked issue in the current or next wave

## Status Indicators

| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ⏳ | Pending — not started |
| 🔄 | In Progress — sub-agent running |
| ✅ | Complete — PR merged |
| ❌ | Failed — bug issue created |
| ⏭️ | Skipped — blocked by failed dependency |
