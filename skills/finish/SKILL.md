# Finish - INTERACTIVE COMMAND

**CRITICAL: This command MUST run in FOREGROUND mode with BLOCKING user confirmation**
**DO NOT run in background - MUST wait for user input at Step 4**
**MUST use ~/bin/git-find-base-branch for base branch detection**

Complete the workflow for a finished issue: commit changes (including pre-commit hook modifications), close the issue, merge to base branch, and clean up.

## Input

The user provides: `$ARGUMENTS`

**Parameters (all optional):**
- **issue_number**: Issue number to complete
  - Empty/omitted → auto-detects from current branch name (e.g., 'issue-33-user-login' → issue 33)
  - 'auto' → explicitly auto-detect from current branch name (same as empty)
  - Provided number → uses that specific issue number
- **base_branch**: Target branch for merging
  - Empty/omitted → uses 'auto' algorithm to detect base branch (DEFAULT)
  - 'auto' → auto-detects base branch using ~/bin/git-find-base-branch script
  - Any other value → uses that specific branch name

## Examples

```bash
/finish              # Auto-detect issue + auto-detect base branch (FULLY AUTOMATIC)
/finish 33           # Use issue 33 + auto-detect base branch
/finish 33 auto      # Explicitly use issue 33 + auto-detect base branch
/finish 33 master    # Use issue 33 + force merge into master
/finish auto develop # Auto-detect issue + force merge into develop
```

## What This Command Does

1. Get the current branch name
2. Auto-detect issue number from branch name if not provided
3. Determine base branch based on parameter
4. **Show resolved parameters and ask for confirmation**
5. Run validation suite before proceeding
6. Add all changes and commit with graceful pre-commit hook handling
7. Push the current branch to origin
8. Close the GitHub issue using gh CLI
9. Switch to the base branch and pull latest
10. Merge the issue branch (with --no-ff for merge commit)
11. Push the merged changes
12. Delete the local and remote issue branch
13. Confirm completion

## Implementation Steps

**Step 1:** Get current branch name using `git branch --show-current`

**Step 2:** Determine issue number:
- If issue_number parameter is provided (not 'auto'), use that value
- If issue_number parameter is empty/omitted OR 'auto':
  - Extract from current branch name using regex pattern `issue-(\d+)-.*`
  - Example: 'issue-33-user-login' → issue number 33
  - If no match found, exit with error "Cannot detect issue number from branch name"

**Step 3:** Determine base branch:
- **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS use `~/bin/git-find-base-branch` script for auto-detection
- If base_branch parameter is empty/omitted → Run `~/bin/git-find-base-branch`
- If base_branch parameter is 'auto' → Run `~/bin/git-find-base-branch`
- If base_branch parameter is provided (not 'auto') → Use that specific value
- **NEVER use fallback to 'master'** - always use the script result

**Step 4:** **MANDATORY STOP - INTERACTIVE CONFIRMATION**
**EXECUTION MUST PAUSE HERE FOR USER INPUT - DO NOT CONTINUE AUTOMATICALLY**
- Display resolved parameters:
  - Current branch: [branch_name]
  - Issue number: [issue_number]
  - Base branch: [base_branch] ← MUST be result from ~/bin/git-find-base-branch
- Ask: "Proceed with finishing issue #[issue_number]? (y/N)"
- **STOP EXECUTION and wait for user response**
- **DO NOT PROCEED to Step 5 until user confirms**
- Exit if user doesn't confirm with 'y' or 'Y'

**Step 5:** Run validation suite:
- Check for validation command: `npm run validate:all`, `make validate`, etc.
- Execute if available
- Exit with error if validation fails
- Resolve any problems before continuing

**Step 6:** Stage and commit with pre-commit hook handling:
- Run `git add .`
- Attempt initial commit with message:
  ```
  feat: complete issue #[issue_number] implementation

  ```
- **If commit fails due to pre-commit hooks:**
  - Detect that hooks modified files
  - Run `git add .` again to stage hook modifications
  - Amend the commit with `git commit --amend --no-edit`
  - Verify all changes are committed with `git diff-index --quiet HEAD --`

**Step 7:** Push current branch:
- Try `git push origin [current_branch]`
- If fails, use `git push -u origin [current_branch]` to create upstream

**Step 8:** Close GitHub issue:
- Run `gh issue close [issue_number] --comment "✅ Implementation complete and tested. All validation passed. Merging to [base_branch]."`

**Step 9:** Switch to base branch:
- Run `git checkout [base_branch]`
- Run `git pull origin [base_branch]`

**Step 10:** Merge issue branch:
- Run `git merge --no-ff [issue_branch] -m "Merge branch '[issue_branch]' - closes #[issue_number]"`

**Step 11:** Push merged changes:
- Run `git push origin [base_branch]`

**Step 12:** Delete branches:
- Delete local: `git branch -d [issue_branch]`
- Delete remote: `git push origin --delete [issue_branch]`

**Step 13:** Show success message with summary

## Important Notes

- Always use the auto-detected or provided base branch
- Ensure GitHub CLI (gh) is authenticated
- The command handles pre-commit hook file modifications automatically
- Validation must pass before issue completion
- Stop if any step fails and report the error
- Show progress for each step with emoji indicators
