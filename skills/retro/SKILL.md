# Session Retrospective

Capture operational knowledge from the current session before it is lost to compaction. Turn lessons learned into permanent, reusable artefacts.

## Input

Optional focus area: `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. "auth", "deployment", "database"). If provided, narrow the retro to that topic. If empty, review the full session.

## Phase 1: Analyse the Session

Review the conversation for knowledge worth preserving. Look for:

**From debug sessions:**
- Multiple approaches were tried before one worked
- A workaround was discovered for a known limitation
- A specific sequence of steps was required (auth flow, API call order, environment setup)
- Configuration or credentials were needed in a non-obvious way

**From implementation sessions:**
- An architectural decision was made after evaluating alternatives (capture the reasoning, not just the choice)
- A library or tool required non-obvious configuration
- A pattern emerged that should be followed consistently (e.g. how to add a new API endpoint, how to structure a migration)
- Integration between components required a specific approach (e.g. order of initialisation, correct event to hook into)

**From deployment/config sessions:**
- Infrastructure required a specific setup sequence
- Environment variables or service configuration that was non-trivial to get right
- Permissions, networking, or DNS that required specific steps

For each finding, summarise:
- **Problem:** what was being attempted
- **Failed approaches:** what did not work and why
- **Working solution:** what finally worked
- **Root cause:** why the working approach succeeds

If the session had no knowledge worth capturing, say so. Do not invent artefacts.

## Phase 2: Classify Each Finding

Assign each finding to exactly one category:

| Category | Output | Where it goes |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Project procedure | Section in project CLAUDE.md under `## Learned Procedures` | Project repo only |
| Architectural decision | Section in project CLAUDE.md under `## Design Decisions` | Project repo only |
| Utility script | Executable script in project `scripts/` directory | Project repo only |
| Project pattern | Section in project CLAUDE.md under `## Project Patterns` | Project repo only |
| Environment/config note | Section in project CLAUDE.md under `## Environment Notes` | Project repo only |
| Toolkit candidate | All of the above PLUS a proposal file | Project repo + `~/.claude/toolkit-proposals/` |

**Default is always project-local.** A finding is a toolkit candidate ONLY if it meets ALL of these criteria:
- It is not tied to a specific project's URLs, endpoints, or data model
- The underlying pattern (not the specific implementation) would be useful in at least one other project
- It can be parameterised (base URL, credentials source, etc.)

## Phase 3: Generate Output

### For CLAUDE.md additions

Read the project's CLAUDE.md first. Append findings under the appropriate section (`## Learned Procedures`, `## Design Decisions`, `## Project Patterns`, or `## Environment Notes`). Create the section if it does not exist. Format as a concise procedure with DO and DO NOT bullets. Reference any created scripts.

Before adding, check if a similar procedure already exists — update it rather than creating a duplicate.

### For utility scripts

Create in the project's `scripts/` directory. Requirements:
- Self-contained and executable (`chmod +x`)
- Usage comment at the top
- Credentials from environment variables or .env, never hardcoded
- Error handling with clear messages
- Referenced from CLAUDE.md

### For auto-memory updates

Also write findings to the project's auto-memory directory (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`). Determine the correct memory path from the current working directory.

- Create topic-specific files for detailed findings (e.g. `auth-patterns.md`, `deployment-notes.md`, `debugging-db.md`)
- Add a one-line link in `MEMORY.md` pointing to the topic file (e.g. `- See [auth-patterns.md](auth-patterns.md) for session auth flow`)
- Keep `MEMORY.md` entries brief — it has a 200-line limit and is always loaded into context
- If a relevant topic file already exists, append to it rather than creating a new one

### For toolkit candidates

Do everything above for the project-local version, then ALSO create a proposal file at `~/.claude/toolkit-proposals/<name>.md` containing:
- Name and one-line description
- The problem pattern it solves (generic, not project-specific)
- Which projects would benefit
- A sketch of what the generalised version would look like (parameterised script, or skill SKILL.md outline)

## Phase 4: Present Summary and Confirm

Group output into sections:

```
## Session Retro Summary

### Project artefacts
- CLAUDE.md: added/updated <section> with <description>
- scripts/<name>.sh: <what it does>
- memory/<topic>.md: <what was captured>

### Toolkit candidates (if any)
- <name>: <one-line description> → ~/.claude/toolkit-proposals/<name>.md
```

**Wait for confirmation before making any changes.**

After confirmation, make all changes and commit with message format:

```
retro: capture <brief description>

Artefacts:
- <list of files created/modified>
```

## Rules

- Never store credentials or secrets. Always reference environment variables.
- Prefer updating existing procedures over creating duplicates. Check CLAUDE.md first.
- Keep procedures concise. Future sessions need to scan them quickly.
- If the session had no knowledge worth capturing, say so. Do not invent artefacts.
- For design decisions, capture the reasoning and the alternatives considered — not just the final choice.
- When in doubt about toolkit candidacy, keep it project-local. Promote later via `/promote`.
